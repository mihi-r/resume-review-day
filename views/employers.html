                <p>Resume Review Day is an event hosted by the Engineering and Applied Science Tribunal in order to help prepare students for the Career Fair. This event gives students the opportunity to sign up for <span class="review-interval"></span> minute intervals to receive resume feedback from industry leaders and gives students the ability to network with employers before the Technical Career Fair. <br><br>
        
                    It is also used as a chance for employers to build student relations, as well as get face-to-face time with additional students that might be seeking a co-op at no cost to them. The event will take place on <span class="event-date"></span> from <span class="event-time"></span> with breakfast in the morning and a lunch break from <span class="lunch-time"></span>. A parking pass voucher will also be provided. <br><br>
            
                    Please provide the following information about yourself and your company. You are welcome to come for as many or as few hours as you like. If you are registering for someone else, please ensure that we have the information of the person who will be attending the event, as the specified email address and phone number will be used for all future contact regarding the Resume Review Day.
                    
                    The last day to sign up will be on <span class="deadline"></span>. <br><br>
                    
                    If you have any questions, please contact us at <a class="admin-email"></a>.
